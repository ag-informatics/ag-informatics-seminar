# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Food & Agriculture: User Journey Mapping Activity

Human-Computer Interaction is a discipline in which we consider the human experience of technology. We explore how and why people use technology to do work, design tools to accommodate the needs, capabilities, and desires of different types of users, and ultimately seek to improve the relationship between humans and technologies. 

We will do an activity in class today where you will CREATE A USER JOURNEY MAP to articulate factors that influence the various users of the technology that you work on. We'll be loosely following this [Nielsen Norman guide](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/). More variants exist, like this one from the [Service Design guide](https://www.thisisservicedesigndoing.com/methods/mapping-journeys)

**Activity Goal** We will create a user journey map that represents a single person's experience in interacting with a technology to better understand (a) flow of logic, (b) factors that influence design, and (c) opportunities 

### SCOPE 
1. Agricultural Task: Choose a specific agricultural task focus on. Consider choosing one that people in your domain design technology for. Draw or write out little description to orient us.


2. Actor: Choose which user(s) you will focus on. Let's create a rough persona for this user. An example persona is shown below.

3. Actor-Tech Goal: Make sure you include a one-sentence goal that this person wants to accomplish using your chosen tech.

### MAPPING

1. Scenario -> Actions: Think about what the use needs to accomplish using your chosen technology. Map out the major phases they would go through to do to accomplish their goal. Inside each phase, write out the specific steps.

2. Emotions and Obstacles: Annotate your user journey map with how you think the person may feel as they are going through these steps based on your experience working with real users. Consider that if they are using your chosen technology there may be specific challenges they encounter as they try to accomplish their goal.

3. Opportunities: Annotate your map with opportunities for design. These can be either pain points you think can be resolved through improved design or areas where you think something more supportive could be created. 

Here's an example from the article I shared previously.

# Submission
Write 1 page topic analysis as follows:

1. Heading: contains your name, the week, the date, and the discussion topic title.

2. Summary: A 1 paragraph summary of the topic based on the readings and other materials shared for the week.

3. Short responses to questions:
	- What types of user factors are you most concerned with in our work?
	- What are 2-3 lessons learned from these papers? Please reference the papers appropriately in your response so that we know which papers you're referring to.
