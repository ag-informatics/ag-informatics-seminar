# User Perspectives

First, we'll take a look at farmer perspectives on ag tech and data to understand what the current state + challenges are - you'll pick one of three articles depending on your interests. We'll all come back together to read one specific article that overviews trust issues. Then we'll dive into open source, since it's an oft-proposed solution to bridging the gap between farmers and their tech.

1. Learn about some farmer perspectives on ag-tech/data:

## Overview of the topic

Overview of topic 
With farmers having the expectation to feed the world with the population projection to reach 9+ billion by the year 2050 researchers, private companies, and farmers are trying to optimize every opportunity to make the best decision to maximize yields and profit. Technology is seen to be only one of the avenues to do so.

The readings provide a wonderful understanding of how technology from software to hardware is seen from the farmers point of view, which also raises multiple questions along the way. It discusses who they trust, what they look to gain, and issues/challenges they feel of importance as well as why the importance of technology growth for the data collected. They paint a picture of where it starts in hopes of where it could end, with putting farmers on top of decisions while also accessing there needs. 

I begin to ask myself what is it and what does it look like to have farmers trust ?
Do I understand the importance of their data and the need I am trying to address?
Would my solution be understandable to any or every farmers?


## Short Synopsis of Readings

1a.” Farmer Perspectives on Data 2021”This really breaks down the thoughts of farmers. If one doesn’t speak to , with and for the farmer we will  never know what is needed. The best part to me from this report is the surveys I like visual data and evidence to prove what some one is saying about farmers because I don’t believe there is enough advocates for farmers or  enough listening ears for the voices. 

2a. “Digital and Data-Driven Agriculture: Harnessing the Power of Data for Smallholder” this takes the focus from larger scale companies and farmers down to the more local and back yard farmers. One would ask how their data could be important or even used. It breaks down the flow and even how the challenges might be different from those who run bigger operations. This one hit home the most because my dad is a small farmer not yet middle class but not your local.  One thing I liked so much about this article is the breakdown of the terms and how they are incorporated. 

3a. The focus is to address why farmers are having trust issues on a smaller scale farmer. From surveys and diagrams it really stresses the importance of it but on the stance of protection and security. From research beforehand discovering what angle has the industry taken on the concerns of the farmers to actually pinpointing out why the farmer actually has no trust in the news and last technology software, or hardware built for their usage. 

2b. "Cultivating trust in technology-mediated sustainable agricultural research" our ongoing efforts to develop robust data management technologies and coordination mechanisms for trust-building that reflect the complex, multistakeholder collaborations and values at the core of our project, It goes over the importance of trust and that process along with the roll farmers data has in the development and management of it.

3c. open source technology is the innovation to evolution is my favorite quote from this article because I didn’t understand its importance and the difference


## Summary of Key Takeaways from the Materials

Trust and perspective matter for the user just as much as the solutions and effectiveness. Surveys given should be given to farmers after every year in my opinion if it is possible. This information is very relatable for every field under the ABE department. It opened my eyes to what I should think about moving forward and what to keep in mind when thinking about the user. I said one think in class that I want to add of think about driving the solution as a user or for the next person to take what you have done and innovate it.

## Discussion Questions

1.	Do you believe that the data collected is used and understood like any other field? Why or why not?
2.	Who is your audience for the data you’re collecting?
3.	Does the result help anyone specifically in need if so have you inquired the audience for enough information to determine if you solution matches the need?

# Discussion Notes and Feedback
Note taker: Megan Low

### Activity:
- Played the moderator's game where companies A and B (played by two individuals) had to pitch their farm software (with pre-set features assigned to them) to a prospective user (played by a third individual) without knowing the user's actual needs. 

### Discussion:
1. **What does it look like to gain a farmers trust?** Do users feel safer if a company discloses upfront "I am sharing your data but this is who I'm sharing with" or don’t disclose at all?
2. Pair **global perspectives with US perspectives**.
	- Sharing data with government in the US receives a lot of pushback - typically politically driven here. May be more trusted in some countries - e.g., in Fiji, government officials welcomed onto farms. Therefore, important to **dial into regional perspectives.**
    - Lots are driven by culture - not just country's culture, but specifically the **rural culture** in those countries. E.g., collective or individualistic culture?
    - Use case from Cheyenne on 1) wariness with govt and 2) generational differences: Govt asked lots of questions for regulation during COVID. Dad’s perspective was “they’re suddenly asking for info that I have never given”. In order to receive benefits, had to give up data. To Cheyenne, understood why they were collecting it and what it was being used for, but not the dad.
3. The idea of **what's most important to us?** For a farmer, when it feels more personal, then decide where and how you handle data. 
    - Sometimes we don’t know what can make us "vulnerable". The idea of meaning of vulnerability/privacy changing over time: Back then we were told not to share our location and address with strangers - now the opposite, for safety, people ask to share live location, uber asking for address etc.
    - Even consider those who grew up with Tiktok - more used to being exposed.
    	- Since preferences change over time, do we keep these values with new farmer generation? How do we respect concerns of previous owner while ensuring long term success?
4. Question in class: Why do user perspectives lag in ag tech? In food science, consumer perception (willingness to pay, sensory tests) are the bread & butter. 
	- Human factors only exist in ag in machinery/safety systems e.g., designing ergonomic shovels and tractors. Industry designing ag *tech* has been focused on solving interoperability issues, usefulness, etc - no bandwidth for finding out *why it hasn’t been accepted*. In research, a lot of social scientists trying to understand acceptance or adoption - have not typically worked with other types of ag researchers.
	- Constructing the tool is easy. This is the difference in **programming vs software engineering**. The latter considers engineering qualities like in other types of systems.
6. Question in class: What is open source?
	- **Open source** = gives ability to **"look under the hood"**. Know the exact specs -  can change, add, replace it. 
		- Note: There are *varying levels* of open. 
		- Examples: Can download and know how Linux OS is built -> equivalent of buying the lego kit. When it matters enough, we want to build it.
	- **Closed source** = no access to the source code, no public repo 
7. Question in class: How to ensure maintenance? What about the mentality of "someone else will keep that up to date" so no one does. 
	- This is the **tragedy of the commons** - one of the many threats to open source, along with being un-user friendly. That’s why you want farmer engagement (user perspecitves) to catch *user bugs* and not just tech bugs.
8. Cheyenne - Put yourself in the driver's seat. How easy can a farmer access this? What would be the price? How would my farmer be able to tap into this easily? What can they do with their information? From the tool we build, as a researcher, we are getting information we need but remind ourselves *what can we give them?*
9. **Key challenges:** 
	1) Educating the user - On how we’re manipulating data - when the app shows "here is the recommendation", it should teach the user along the way of why 
	2) Marketing - so much of ag tech relies on marketing. Fall trap to overselling even in our research.
11. When thinking of collecting user's perspectives, **don’t have to always go to the end end user, can go to the person who understands enough about the use case**. E.g., extension staff are literally a walking user perspective guide. 
12. Check out [this Purdue Precision Ag survey](https://ag.purdue.edu/digitalag/_media/croplife-report-2022.pdf) - example of getting feedback from users (farmers).
