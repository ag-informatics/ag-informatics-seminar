# ABE 591 - Research & Practice in Agricultural Informatics

This course will empower you to think critically about the role of digital technologies in food systems and agriculture, and provide a structured experience for you to implement a project of your choosing. We will alternate between two lecture formats over the semester. The first lecture format will be discussion-based meetings where students will review state of the art in research and practice on topics in digital agriculture, and engage in critical assessment of topics such as: data ethics, open source, sensing across scales, algorithmic bias, design justice, etc. We will dig into informatics research and consider how it influences the design of technologies for food and agricultural systems. Students will engage in one research/development project in which you either a) write a research article, or b) implement an informatics project in the domain of food systems and agriculture. Thus, the second lecture format will be workshop-style meetings in which students will report on their project process and challenges, provide peer-feedback and review, or simply use the space to get input on their work. Those who took Intro to Ag Informatics (Fall 2021) can build out their previously propose solution, while new students will be invited to put together a short proposal before diving into their implementation. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Identify, describe, and explain fundamental digital technologies and their applicability to key informatics challenges in food and agricultural systems.
2. Discuss and analyze the state of the art of research and practice in agricultural informatics.
3. Demonstrate critical and computational thinking skills for agricultural informatics research and development.
4. Conceptualize or prototype an agricultural informatics solution an open food system or agricultural challenge.

# Course Structure & Schedule
We will switch between two types of lectures, the "Discussion Format" and the "Workshop Format":

**Discussion Format:** I will assign a selection of readings, videos, and other materials for the week. Each student is expected to review them and create a "Topic Analysis" submission that summarizes their notes. One student will be assigned to be the "Moderator" for each discussion - this person will lead the group in discussion, bringing critical questions and notes, supplemental materials as relevant, and will write the "Topic Brief" as a post-discussion activity. Each person is expected to be a moderator once during the semester.

**Workshop Format:** Each student is expected to conduct a research or development project over the course of the semester. Each student is expected to share their work once during the semester, sending the class a draft paper, prototoype or other materials that you would like feedback on. Each student will be expected to provide "Peer Feedback" for everyone's projects.

# Support & Policies

## Attendance Policy
This course is designed in a hybrid model, with some face-to-face meetings and others completed remotely. University policy states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. For the purposes of this course, being “present” means participating in-person or remotely as described in the course structure and completing work assigned for days when we do not meet face-to-face. This work is required to help you meet the course learning outcomes. These times count toward the course contact hours and your course grade. 

That said, this has been a complicated few years, and you can contact me if you have any challenges/concerns with attending classes in-person. Guidance on class attendance related to COVID-19 are outlined in the [Protect Purdue Pledge](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/) for Spring 2022 on the Protect Purdue website. 

## Classroom Guidance Regarding Protect Purdue
Your health and safety is important. If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation. 

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person is threatening the safety of others by not complying with Protect Purdue protocols is encouraged to report the behavior to and discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option of reporting the behavior to the [Office of the Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/). See also [Purdue University Bill](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights) of Student Rights and the Violent Behavior Policy under University Resources in Brightspace.
