<!-- Course Syllabus -->

# ASM 591 - Research & Practice in Agricultural Informatics

This course invites critical discussion about the role of digital technologies in food systems and agriculture. It provides a structured experience for you to workshop your dissertation research (paper, prototype, or ideas!). We will collectively choose the topics to cover for the semester in Weeks 1 & 2. Two lecture formats are used: The first lecture format will be discussion-based meetings where students will evaluate, assess, and critique research papers and software in digital agriculture, engaging in critical assessment of topics of our collective choosing e.g., data ethics, open source, sensing across scales, algorithmic bias, design justice, etc. We will dig into informatics research and consider how it influences the design of technologies for food and agricultural systems. Students will engage in one research/development project in which you either a) write a research article, or b) implement an informatics project in the domain of food systems and agriculture. Thus, the second lecture format will be workshop-style meetings in which students will report on their project process and challenges, provide peer-feedback and review, or simply use the space to get input on their work. 

Requirement: Bring a project that you are already working on, or have a specific topic are that you are exploring as part of your graduate work. Reach out if you have questions!

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Identify, describe, and explain fundamental digital technologies and their applicability to key informatics challenges in food and agricultural systems.
2. Discuss and analyze the state of the art of research and practice in agricultural informatics.
3. Demonstrate critical and computational thinking skills for agricultural informatics research and development.
4. Conceptualize or prototype an agricultural informatics solution an open food system or agricultural challenge.

# Course Structure & Schedule
We will switch between two types of lectures, the "Discussion Format" and the "Workshop Format":

**Discussion Format:** I will assign a selection of readings, videos, and other materials for the week. One student will be assigned to be the "Moderator" for each discussion - this person will lead the group in discussion, bringing critical questions and notes, supplemental materials as relevant, and will write the "Topic Brief" as a post-discussion activity. Each person is expected to be a moderator once during the semester. Everybody else is expected to engage with the materials in a manner that is productive for you, e.g.: write a summary analysis of topics, replicate the code in a paper, try out a method on the topic. At minimum, I expect a "topic analysis" that is a 1-page written reflection on the materials, but this is a choose your own adventure course, so we can discuss other options each week.

**Workshop Format:** Each student is expected to conduct a research or development project over the course of the semester. Each student is expected to share their work once during the semester, sending the class a draft paper, prototoype or other materials that you would like feedback on. Each student will be expected to provide "Peer Feedback" for everyone's projects.

**Proposed Schedule/Topics:** This section will be updated as we assign moderators and adjust topics. 
Note: 3 classes are listed as "1hr classes" becuase I have a College of Agriculture meeting that I cannot move!

# Course Feedback & Evaluation
This is the inaugural offering of this "special topics" course, which means components are actively under development and there may be bugs! I would love to hear about your experience, get feedback on the course materials, and generally learn more about where and how this course fails/succeeds to meet your needs. No need to wait till the end!

**Reporting issues in Github**: Found a bug in the code, slides, syllabus, or other materials? Have a suggestion for how to improve this course? Submit an "issue" to this repository! Alternatively, send a message on the "issues" slack channel.

**Course Evaluation**: During the last two weeks of the semester, you will be provided with an opportunity to give feedback on this course and your instructor. Purdue uses an online course evaluation system. You will receive an official email from evaluation administrators with a link to the online evaluation site. You will have up to 13 days to complete this evaluation. Your participation is an integral part of this course, and your feedback is vital to improving education at Purdue University. I strongly urge you to participate in the evaluation system. This will be very helpful in helping refine and revise this course to deliver a better student experience!

# Support & Policies

## Attendance Policy
This course is designed in a hybrid model, with some face-to-face meetings and others completed remotely. University policy states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. For the purposes of this course, being “present” means participating in-person or remotely as described in the course structure and completing work assigned for days when we do not meet face-to-face. This work is required to help you meet the course learning outcomes. These times count toward the course contact hours and your course grade. 

That said, this has been a complicated few years, and you can contact me if you have any challenges/concerns with attending classes in-person. Guidance on class attendance related to COVID-19 are outlined in the [Protect Purdue Pledge](https://protect.purdue.edu/pledge/) for Spring 2022 on the Protect Purdue website. 

## Classroom Guidance Regarding Protect Purdue
Your health and safety is important. If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation. 

Any student who has substantial reason to believe that another person is threatening the safety of others by not complying with Protect Purdue protocols is encouraged to report the behavior to and discuss the next steps with their instructor. Students also have the option of reporting the behavior to the [Office of the Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/). See also [Purdue University Bill](https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=2852#purdue-university-bill-of-student-rights) of Student Rights and the Violent Behavior Policy under University Resources in Brightspace. 

## Accessibility
Purdue University is committed to making learning experiences accessible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are welcome to let me know so that we can discuss options. You are also encouraged to contact the Disability Resource Center at: drc@purdue.edu or by phone: 765-494-1247.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breaches of this value by either emailing integrity@purdue.edu or by calling 765-494-8778. While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information is submitted the greater the opportunity for the university to investigate the concern. More details are available on our course Brightspace table of contents, under University Policies.

## Nondiscrimination Statement
Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her potential. In pursuit of its goal of academic excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture diversity. The University believes that diversity among its many members strengthens the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes the exchange of ideas, and enriches campus life.
