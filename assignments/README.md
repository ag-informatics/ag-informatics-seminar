# 1. Project Contract
**In the first 3 weeks of this semester, you will create a 1 page Project Contract and meet with the Instructor**. This document should describe:

1. What you will submit as your final project: research paper or software prototype? Make sure the description of your proposed work is clear and brief.

2. Who is your support? This is ideally something you're interested in working on for your research, portfolio, practice, etc., and is something you have additional support for outside this course (e.g., a mentor, advisor, etc.). If you were in ASM591 last Fall, feel free to build off of your project, or do something else entirely, whatever is most useful for you.

3. What is the scope of the work? Include the timeline of your activitites with the intended final submission date lining up with Week 16 of Spring 2022.

4. What do you anticipate sharing during your Project work-in-progress Update? We can discuss what's appropriate, but suggest something to begin with!

5. **Upload this document to Brightspace before you meet with me so that we have a document to discuss.** You can revise it after our meeting, I just want to have some idea of what you're thinking before we chat. This is not graded separately, but if you do not submit something, you will lose 5% of your final project grade.

**Schedule a meeting with the Instructor, Ankita, so that we can agree that this is an appropriate amount of work.** You will work on your project independently over the course of the semester. I will be available to provide feedback, guidance, and general support. You will have an opportunity for peer feedback during your Workshop Presentation.

# 2. Topic Analysis
I will assign a set of materials for Discussion weeks (see schedule above). Every week, we will engage with the materials differently, so I will have a section in the readings called "Expected Submission" that describes what I suspect you will submit for the week. If you choose to engage with the materials differently, that's fine too. Remember, the grading rubric is: 0 for no submission, 50% for a low engagement/effort, and 100% for engaging with the topic adequately.

# 3. Moderator Topic Brief
**During the week you are assigned as "Discussion Moderator" you will create a set of prompts/questions to lead the discussion, and summarize the group discussion as a "Topic Brief".** If you are the assigned moderator for the Discussion week, you DO NOT have to create the "Topic Analysis" described above. 

Instead you will need to do the following:

1. Closely parse the assigned materials.

2. Navigate to the relevant discussion topic folder in Github. Make sure you have cloned and done a recent "pull" on the course repository so you have the latest updates.

3. You will edit the README.md file for YOUR discussion topic, filling out all the required sections in the template.

4. Make a "Pull Request" on the main course repository and I will integrate your changes so that everyone can view your brief just before class.

5. Come prepared to lead the discussion. You will be expected to give a 10 minute presentation, using slides, your notes, whatever you'd like, to kick-off the discussion in-class.

6. After class, update your discussion topic and **Submit the link to the github page via Brigthspace**


# 4. Project in-progress Update

Everyone is expected to present once during the semester. There is no set format for your project update. Instead consider the following order of operations:

1. Before your assigned workshop presentation, you MUST send out something for your peers to review. This can be a link to a prototype, a paper draft, and outline of your methods, whatever you are working on as your Agricultural Informatics "project" for this semester. You must additionally provide your peers with guidance about what you'd like feedback ON. Your submission should include:
	- A draft of your paper, a link to the prototype on github, a link to your mockups. whatever you have so far. You need to provide people something to actually review!
	- A short set of instructions about what type of feedback you'd like: do you want people to look for holes in your paper rationale? some light user testing?

2. During your assigned timeslot, we will give you 20 minutes to provide an update, we will then spend 20 minutes of class time in feedback discussion. 

3. You will receive peer feedback on your work after your presentation.


**Upload your materials in Brightspace the Friday before our class @ 5pm. Share them on Slack with your peers as well.**

# 5. Project Peer Feedback

You will provide feedback for each of your peers. I will share these with the presenter so these must be written in a constructive tone.  Please review the work as though you would a paper- simply provide comments on the document. Alternatively you can provide no more than one page of summarized feedback listing out:

1. Strengths
2. Areas for improvement
3. Suggestions/Recommended resources

**Upload your materials in Brightspace the Friday after our class @ 5pm.**

# 6. Project Final Submission
First, your final submission:
 - If you wrote code, a brief report (<2 pages) outlining what you accomplished (see slides outline below). If you wrote any code, have updated mockups, or have a demo, you can submit that too.
 - If you wrote a paper, a brief (<2 pages) outlining what you accomplished (see slides outline below). Submit the current state of your draft, if applicable.

Next, your presentation: you will give a 10 minute presentation in class on Wed April 27. Your slides should cover:
1. Project overview
2. What you had originally proposed (review project contract)
3. What you did this semester (outline your major accomplishments)
4. Challenges and, where applicable, how you overcame the challenges OR what you need to move forward
5. What comes next

You will be graded on the content of your 2 page report + presentation, not on the quality of your final project/paper since those are larger parts of your research :)
