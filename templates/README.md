# FYI: Creating a Pull Request

*IMPORTANT:*

Before beginning your work ensure that you first create a "fork" from the course GitHub page. This creates a copy of the ag-informatics-seminar course content onto *your* GitHub repository. From this point you should git clone this repository onto your device and proceed by making edits to the desired file in that location. Below are three YouTube videos that I found helpful when learning how to create a pull request, additionally I also encountered some issues when using Terminal git commands and was able to fairly easily find solutions on stackoverflow.com . Let me know if you have any additional questions!
