# Preamble: How to Read

Some quick caveats and resources on reading. You don't have to read all resources/papers equally, consider reading this quick guide on how to read effectively for research:

1. How do I read a paper: I read the title and abstract. Make a note of things to look out for. I skim the introduction to get a sense of the motivation/main question, but if the topic is unfamiliar, the intro gets read more closely for valuable context and fundamentals. I look through major figures/tables to get a sense for what to expect. I "heading" hop - skip from intro to conclusion skimming major headings/sections to get a sense of the structure of the paper, giving myself a feel for what to expect and decide where to focus. I read the conclusion-like section see what the authors think the main contributions are. And then I come back to middle and do a "second pass" focusing on the areas that I think will be most valuable for my learning. I annotate papers with my thoughts in the margins, mark out references that I'd like to follow up and read, as mark up quotes to use in my writing/learning. ONLY when I need to deep read, do I then do a third pass (e.g., when reviewing a paper, building new knoweldge base, dense topics, etc.). In this course, I expect that moderators may do 3 passes, but with many of the resources, you're skimming and looking for the main points. 

2. A more thorough guide, that is perhaps more relevant for longer texts is here: https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf. Again, when they say to "read" a paper 3 times, consider: the first time you skim for discovery, the second time you might read deeper to understand more, and the third time, you're writing down snippets. In this course, moderators might will have to do all three, but everyone else should be doing only 1-2 quick passes. This article was also written as a guide for reading books, but the principles can apply to papers.

Write 1 page topic analysis as follows:

1. Heading: contains your name, the week, the date, and the discussion topic title.

2. Summary: A 1 paragraph summary of the topic based on the readings and other materials shared for the week.

3. Short responses to questions:
	- How do you interpret digital agriculture in your work?
	- How did these readings influence your ideas about the present and future of digital agriculture?
	- What are 2-3 lessons learned from these papers? Please reference the papers appropriately in your response so that we know which papers you're referring to.

4. Questions: A list of 3-5 questions for the in-class discussion.

# Digital Agriculture: Part 2: Software Show & Tell

Come to class prepared to show us a piece of software that you think of as an example of a digital agricultural tool. 

You will share your screen (or if it's a mobile app you're welcome to just take screenshots for us and stick them in miro/slides), and show us a 2 minute demo of how it's used. 

This week, please each person should create provide **1 page** overview of the tool. You will submit this on Brightspace. Here's the questions I want you to answer:

	1) About the Tool: What does it do? When was it built? Who built it and why? 

	2) Utility: How useful is it for users (farmers, managers, workers, etc)?

	3) Usability: How easy is it to use?

	4) Interoperability: can we move data across tools, devices, systems? 

	5) Trust: what data is being collected and how is it being used/retained? 

	6) Resilient: do you think this is a robust, reliable, or adaptable tool? Will it stand / has it stood the test of time?

	7) Why is this a good piece of software?

	8) What are some issues with it?

	9) How would you make it better?


# Expected Submission
Everyone should submit a 2 page document on Brightspace containing a) responses to the questions regarding the readings in part 1, and b) reposnses to the questions regarding your chosen software in part 2.
