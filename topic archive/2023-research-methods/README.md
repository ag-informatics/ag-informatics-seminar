# Research Methods 101

This document is written assuming that you are doing research in the domain of agricultural informatics. This is a very very quick overview of research methods, primarily focusing this semester on two topics (1) literature reviews and (2) communicating findings.

## Topic Submission

This week, we will review a few resources in class together. Over the course of the class, we will pause to make notes on your specific research context. By the end of the class, you should have enough of an outline to submit a document containing the following headings:

Everyone: **"Situating your work".**  Based on the discussion related to Part 1: The Research Lifecycle, determine where in the research project planning phase you are at. In particular, review the section "Defining a Topic". In less than 1 paragraph, describe how you decided and/or are currently deciding what to study? What is your personal motivation for conducting research?


Option 1: **"Literature Review".** If you are conducting a literature review this semester, you will need to submit your 1 page action plan (as we create together in class). 

**OR**

Option 2: **"Communicating your Findings".** If you are not doing a literature review, then instead describe any current effort you are undertaking to communicate your research, whether it's a paper, a presentation, or even a chapter of your dissertation. Do not write more than 1 page, it's an informal informational writeup.


## Part 1: The Research LifeCycle

First, review the SAGE methods Research Planner: https://methods.sagepub.com/project-planner

This contains a series of sections:

![project planner section list](../img/sage-project-planner.png)

Depending on where in the PhD process you are, you will likely move through all these stages, from identifying research topics, about to do you literature review, planning your dissertation proposal, all the way through to writing up your dissertation and communicating your findings. Though this tool was designed for research in the social sciences, it provides a helpful overview of the phases of research - the actual methods you use for each phase, will differ based on discipline, maturity of the research area, your advisor/lab style, and your own interest and goals.

Consider, if you haven't already, working through an Individual Development Plan, or something like this with your advisor: https://ag.purdue.edu/department/arge/graduate-programs/mentoring.html

## Part 2: Literature Review 
In this section, we'll overview a few resources to help you put together a plan of action to conduct your literature review. 

> Answer QX: You'll see sections written like this with a question for you to answer in your "action plan". This is intended to help you get started on your literature review, but you'll also submit the asnwers to these questions in your submission for this week.

### 2.1 Why?
Literature reviews are a great way to gain familiarity with a set of topics related to your area of interest. A scientific literature review prioritizes review of research outputs that are "recognized as valuable", i.e., peer reviewed. They allow you to (1) establish context for your work, (2) expose knowledge gaps, and (3) demonstrate research effort (Paraphrased from [this resource](https://ecp.engineering.utoronto.ca/resources/online-handbook/components-of-documents/literature-reviews/))

> Answer Q1. What's your research motivation for doing a literature review? What are you hoping to accomplish, learn, or find?

### 2.2 Part or Whole? 
Literature reviews can be (1) stand-alone documents, e.g., an in-depth review article, or (2) a single section in a document, e.g., the background section of a paper or even a thesis. Depending on your goal, you can create reviews that are anywhere from a couple of paragraphs to a whole book! [This ASU guide](https://libguides.asu.edu/engineeringlitreview/whatis) has some nice examples of these different types of reviews.

> Answer Q2. Is your literature review (1) a stand-alone document, or (2) part of something else? Please explain.

### 2.3 Literature Review Types
There are many types of literature reivews - from rapid overviews of a landscape, to reviews intended to help you narrow your research scope, to systematic reviews intended to provide a comphrensive overview of an entire field. Each of these take varying amounts of time and effort, and it is important to select a literature review type (and thus methodology) that matches your goals. Read the ["literature review type definitions" summarized here](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc/writing-theses/writing/literature-reviews).

> Answer Q3. What type of literature review are you doing? Explain why/how this is applicable. Which, if any of the methods listed might you want to try?


### 2.4 Formulating your Research Question(s)
At this stage, you may not yet have a specific set of research questions that you are trying to answer, but you likely have a good sense of the topic(s) you're interesed in exploring. 

It's valuable to write out a set of overarching questions that you can refine over time to guide your search. Consider writing out a few notes for each of the following:

> Answer Q4a. What are some questions to guide your literature review?

Let's say I'd like to focus my research on designing new information tools to help farmers with crop management, my guiding questions might include, for example:
		- how do people use data to make agricultural decisions?
		- what makes a decision support tool usable and/or useful?


 > Answer Q4b. What are some topics, phrases, and/or keywords about the area you are interested in reviewing?

To continue with my example, I might use the phrases and words: decision making in agriculture, farmer decision support tools, decision support tool design criteria, etc. Unless you're doing a highly structured systematic literature review, your set of of topics/phrases/keywords can change as you learn more and refine your search.

### 2.5 Scoping your Search Space
In Agricultural Informatics, I find it helpful to think about my problem area from the two dimensions separately at first. These are in effect subdisciplines where I might focus my search. 

**X. Food & Agriculture:** If I'm interested in crop management, I might have different categories for several crops (vegetables, grains, fruits). If I'm interested in soil health, I might list out different soil health practices (cover crops, no-till, composting).

**Y. Informatics:** If I'm looking at different ways in which people are collecting data about soil health, I might write a set of data collection methods (sampling, remote sensing, observation). If I'm interested in learning about the breadth of tools available, I might list out specific types of functionality (record keeping, traceability, logistics). 

All in all, the goal is to have a set of criteria by which I can start to think about the topic from both dimensions. 

> Answer Q5. What are the dimensions and categories that you will start with to scope your search space?

### 2.6 Process: Find-Read-Annotate-Summarize
Once you have your set of topics to search, I encourage you to pick one topic (or cluster of topics) at a time, and iterate through:

1. Find: As you start finding papers, begin to add them into a Zotero folder and/or a spreadsheet where you can start to track some basic information about your findings. You can start to categorize your papers, to ensure that you have good coverage of the topics that you are interested in exploring. Resist the urge to add tens of paper at a time to your library without reviewing them. Instead, as you find papers relevant to your topic:
	- Read the title and abstract to determine fit. If yes, then:
		- add to Zotero library and place in a folder specific to this literature review. Tag as appropriate. 
		- add to spreadsheet and categorize the paper. Make notes about any assumptions/issues. 
	- If new categories come up, feel free to add them to your original list.
Answer QAnswer Q
2. Read-Annotate: Once you have a set of papers on a specific topic, make sure to start reading and annotating them. Methods for annotation and beginning to synthesize information across literature include:

	- Create an [annotated bibliography document](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/index.html). You're writing this for yourself (and maybe your advisor/collaborators) so don't worry about writing formally - do what works for you. Some useful questions to inform your reading and writing process are [listed in this guide](https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/literature-review/).For each paper, you might write:
		- Summary of the paper
		- Key ideas and/or takeways
		- Quotes, statistics, and/or figures of note (with page numbers)
		- Any references you may want to follow up with
		- Any major criticisms or challenges you have with the work
		- Any ideas/thoughts you have as a result of reading this paper.

	
	- Creating a literature review grid of common points: https://guides.library.vcu.edu/ld.php?content_id=1720462
	- Creating a synthesis matrix: https://guides.library.vcu.edu/ld.php?content_id=1720465

	These are complementary to the annotated bibliography approach, and you may want to keep a running spreadsheet/matrix of some sort where you track findings, gaps, or other common themes across the papers your read.

> Answer Q6. Create a template for you to use once you get to this stage of your literature review. Do what works for you, examples include: an annotated bibliography template, a spreadsheet for managing your papers, a literature review grid, or a synthesis matrix.

3. Synthesize: Once you finish a topic "section", take some time to write a draft summary and synthesis of the topic. Since the papers will be fresh in your mind, you should be able to write detailed notes that you can later use in your final write up itself! 

### 2.7 Putting it all together
Your review may present the literature chronologically, thematically, methodologically, or some other way entirely. Purdue has a [good guide on how to organize your information](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/conducting_research/writing_a_literature_review.html). From the guide: *"synthesis is like hosting a dinner party: imagine all your sources are together in a room, discussing your topic. What are they saying to each other*?"* A good synthesis can happen in a discussion section, and this sets apart a literature review for your own information, from a literature review that adds value to the scholarship in your discipline as well. 

A useful literature review doesn't just tell the reader what exists, but gives the reader a way of thinking about a problem by bringing together a symphony of related work.

Finally, here's a quick guide regarding [best practices on when and how to cite references](https://ecp.engineering.utoronto.ca/resources/online-handbook/accurate-documentation/)


### TIP for Peer Feedback on Literature Reviews.
Check out the [Purdue OWL Guide to Literature Reviews](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/graduate_writing/graduate_writing_genres/graduate_writing_genres_graduate_school_specific_genres_new.html). It contains 2 sets of questions under the heading "Questions for Revision" that are useful questions to think about when you are reading someone's literature review and aiming to provid feedback. We will use these later in the semester to provide peer feedback.

## Part 3: Communicating Your Findings

### 1. Writing long form text via LaTex. 

From the [LaTeX website](https://www.latex-project.org/about/): *"LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or «Bertolt Brecht»), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing."* In academia, it is commonly used for writing publication-ready papers and especially for writing theses and dissertations.

Some quick resources:
- LaTex Basics: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics
- Software Editors: I use [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) to edit documents on my Mac computer. There are many other editors available. Since I use Zotero for reference management, I can either directly export a bib file from there, or use [Bibdesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/) to clean it up as needed. There are [many latex distributions](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) that you can choose from.
- Online Editor: Overleaf is a hosted, collaborative LaTeX editor - think google docs meets LaTex. You can learn how to use it here: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes

### 2. Creating reusable slides via RevealJS.

I use the RevealJS package to create my slides. It can be used in conjunction with R, python, HTML, and LaTeX. I can version control my presentations and reuse components, like any other code. Learn more here: https://revealjs.com/. They also have a [software as a service offering](https://slides.com/) (though I don't use it). Basic setup here: https://revealjs.com/installation/#basic-setup

My process is as follows:
1. Use Sublime Text as my very-basic-text editor.
2. Track all my materials in a github repositry, e.g., https://github.com/ag-informatics/ag-informatics-seminar
3. Use the ["submodule"](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) method to link my repository to the RevealJS edition that I use.
4. See an example lecture here: https://github.com/ag-informatics/ag-informatics-seminar/blob/main/lectures/lecture1.html. I have a basic template that I can then reuse every time I make a new lecture :)

### 3. Communicating code + data via Jupyter Notebooks

You can even combine jupyter notebooks with Reveal.JS to turn your code notebook into slides: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-data-driven-presentations-with-jupyter-notebooks-reveal-js-e7a42a1fb7d7
